							<h3><span><em>Econometrics</em> is a four-semester, English-language master&rsquo;s program of TU Dortmund University (TUDO), Ruhr-University Bochum (RUB) and the University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE). The program is offered jointly by the faculties of economics of the three universities and the Faculty of Statistics @ TU Dortmund University. It combines the expertise and breadth of the participating faculties in empirical economic research and economics with the methodically oriented training of the statisticians and econometricians at Germany&rsquo;s only Faculty of Statistics. This unique combination of training and research skills allows to offer a specialized curriculum for quantitatively-oriented students which covers a wide range of topics in econometrics and applied economics.<br><br>Students acquire the ability to combine methodological competence with proficiency in economics. They gain extensive knowledge of econometric methods and models and an in-depth understanding of central economic causal relationships and resulting econometric issues. The program particularly supports research-interested students in developing analytical skills with regard to specific research questions in economics and thus prepares optimally for a doctorate in econometrics or neighbouring disciplines. The master&rsquo;s program in Econometrics thus prepares well for a career in econometrics, empirical economic research, evidence-based policy consulting, or operational research.<br><br>Graduates receive a joint MSc degree from the four participating faculties.</span></h3>

						  <h3 class="to-animate"><em>University Alliance Ruhr</em></h3>
							<h3>Despite being one of the youngest university regions in the country, the Ruhr region has the densest educational landscape in Europe with a total of 22 universities and colleges. The <a href='http://www.uaruhr.de/index.html.en'>University Alliance Ruhr</a> (UAR) is a joint venture of TUDO, RUB and UDE. With more than 120.000 students and almost 1.300 professors, the UAR is Germany’s largest academic hub. It, among others, initiates cooperations in research, teaching and administration. Both the education of economists and economic research benefit from these joint activities, in particular through the <a href='http://en.rwi-essen.de/'>RWI</a> - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research and the <a href='http://rgs-econ.org/'>RGS</a> - Ruhr Graduate School in Economics, which offers a fast-track PhD program in economics. Excellent graduates of <em>Econometrics</em> thus have good prospects for pursuing a further career in academics or economic research.</h3>

						  <h3 class="to-animate"><em>Studying and Living in the Ruhr Area</em></h3>
							<h3>Good news: both national and international students (including non-EU students) can study at the UAR universities for free &ndash; there are <em>no tuition fees</em>. You only pay about 300€ per semester to cover administrative costs and to give you access to free public transport in the region (semester ticket). Also Students in Germany benefit from <em>affordable health insurance</em> plans. <br>Furthermore, the Ruhr area has everything required to make the most of student&rsquo;s life: affordable accommodation, jobs and a wide range of cultural, sporting and leisure activities. Moreover, with the semester ticket being valid for whole North Rhine-Westphalia one easily gets from place to place in the entire area quickly using public transportation. Attending several courses at different locations is thus no problem, even on the same day.<br><br>The student unions of the three universities mediate accommodation in student halls of residence and are happy to help you find a room on the local private housing market.</h3>

    	  <h3>The program is divided into compulsory modules, elective courses and closes with the master thesis. In four compulsory modules (ME1 - ME4) with a total amount of 42 credit points, you acquire a sound knowledge in statistics, econometrics and time series analysis. The core curriculum also conveys skills in applied research, statistical programming, research project management and statistical consulting. <br><br> Elective modules (ME5 - ME6) train students in economic theory (ME5) and provide further specialization in applied (ME6) and theoretical econometrics (ME7).<br><br> In ME6 and ME7, students focus on a specific field of research according to their individual preferences. This results in a flexible number of credits to be acquired by electives, which must, however, amount to a minimum of 11 and a maximum of 26 credit points in each of the elective module areas.<br><br> While core modules and many electives are taught in English, students have the opportunity to attend selected courses held in German.</h3>

  <h3>ME8: Master Thesis</h3>
  <br>
  <p class = "text_ml">
  The master thesis demonstrates that students are able to independently apply and adapt scientific methods to an econometric problem within a given period of time. The processing time is six months. Topics for final theses are offered each semester by several university lecturers, so that students can choose between different offers. Students can also make their own suggestions for topics.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="sec" id="section2">
  <h3>ME4: Time Series Analysis</h3>
  <br>
  <p class = "text_ml">
  The course initially covers methods of descriptive time series analysis. Then, structural theory and estimation of time series models are discussed. Core topics include approximation and elimination of trends, the theory of linear filters, ‘naive’ forecasting, exponential smoothing, stationary stochastic processes, optimal linear forecasts, ARMA-processes, the autocorrelation function, model identification and parameter estimation in the time domain.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="sec" id="section3">
  <h3>ME6: Applied Econometrics</h3>
  <br>
  <p class = "text_ml">

Focus lies on the discussion, adaptation and application of various econometric tools on the one hand and on advanced and up-to-date topics of economic interest on the other hand.
.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="sec" id="section5">
  <h3>ME5: Economics</h3>
  <br>
  <p class = "text_ml">
  Many econometric methods have been developed in line with developments in economics. Therefore, it is important for our students to be familiar with more recent theoretical developments and thus potential areas of application of econometric methods. Depending on the field of interest, the courses have a micro- or macroeconomic orientation. The curriculum covers a variety of courses from the following disciplines: 
  <ul class="tab">
	<li>Applied Macro- and Microeconomics</li>
	<li>Dynamic Macroeconomics</li>
	<li>Game Theory</li>
	<li>Health Economics</li>
	<li>Public Economics</li>
	<li>Financial Economics</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="sec" id="section6">
  <h3>ME7: Econometric Methods</h3>
  <br>
  <p class = "text_ml">
  Modules in ME7 have a strong methodological orientation, i.e. students have the opportunity to acquire in-depth knowledge of econometric methods in selected fields, for example:
  <ul class="tab">
	<li>Stochastic Processes</i></li>
	<li>Unit Root and Cointegration Analysis</li>
	<li>Analysis of Big Data and Machine Learning</li>
	<li>Bayesian Econometrics</li>
	<li>Multivariate Statistical Methods</li>
	<li>Advanced Microeconometrics</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="sec" id="section7">
  <h3>ME1: Statistical Theory</h3>
  <p>
  <p class = "text_ml">
    Participants learn to use the formal language of statistics and gain knowledge of fundamental concepts in stochastics (M1a), decision theory  (M1b) and asymptotic theory (M1c) which are required in order to analyze, apply and further develop statistical procedures.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="sec" id="section8">
  <h3>ME2: Econometrics</h3>
  <br>
  <p class = "text_ml">
  ME2 deals with a wide range of fundamental econometric methods. Special emphasis is placed on asymptotic results to allow for a general discussion of the statistical properties of these methods. The main focus lies on a formally precise description of the concepts. Topics include the linear regression model, the generalized linear regression model, maximum likelihood estimation and inference, asymptotic theory, endogenous regressors, instrumental variables, generalized method of moments and regression models for time series data, among others.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="sec" id="section9">
  <h3>ME3: Case Studies</h3>
  <br>
  <p class = "text_ml">
  The participants solve statistical problems in larger group projects, usually using raw economic data. They are trained in applied research and acquire skills in presenting statistical results and various interdisciplinary qualifications such as teamwork and know-how in project management, communication and consulting. Furthermore, students expand their methodological knowledge and gather experience in statistical programming.</p>
