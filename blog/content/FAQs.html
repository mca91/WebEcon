<div id="can-you-offer-scholarships-to-cover-costs-of-living-housing-etc." class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Can you offer scholarships to cover costs of living (housing etc.)?</strong></h4>
<p>While we can offer the program free of tuition, we unfortunately cannot offer any scholarships for such costs. Some external agencies, possibly in your home country, may be able to assist. There regularly are opportunities for paid positions as student research assistants, which helps cover parts of the cost of living.</p>

<div id="what-are-ects-points" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>What are ECTS points?</strong></h4>
<p>ECTS is for “European Credit Transfer System”. This system guarantees the comparability of achievements gained in the European Higher Education Area by issuing so called credit points (ECTS credits). These credit points exist to give an indication of the student’s average workload per semester or year. They do not function as an evaluation of performance.
The ECTS credits are only awarded if courses are successfully completed. This means that all of the relevant exams have to be passed.</p>

<div id="which-living-costs-should-i-roughly-expect-when-studying-in-germany" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Which living costs should I roughly expect when studying in Germany?</strong></h4>
<p>You should expect to spend a minimum of 750 € to 850 € per month for <it>basic expenses</it>. The costs can be broken down roughly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rent: 350 to 450 €
</li>
<li>
Health insurance: 95 €
</li>
<li>
Food: 260 €
</li>
<li>
Phone &amp; Internet: 30 to 50 €
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the above is a minimum calculation which can be easily exceeded, in particular because rents differ significantly between different cities and districts. Also consider extra costs that you face upon arrival in Germany, some of which are the deposit for accommodation, fees for residence permit, household items etc.</p>
<p>Good news is that students enjoy reductions on many occasions. Student tariffs are available for mobile contracts and many leisure activities.</p>
